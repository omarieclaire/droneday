            <h2>Hello friends! Welcome to Drone Jam</h2>

            <img src="../omarieclaire.github.io/img/drone-jam-min.png" alt="" />

            <p>
              This jam is now over. It ran from May 7th 2022 at 12:00 AM to May
              15th 2022 at 12:05 PM.
            </p>

            <h3>What will we make at drone jam?</h3>
            <p>
              We’ll make experimental games, toys, or playful things related to
              the idea of sustained tones. The games can be digital or physical.
              They can be meandering daydreams. They can be tiny toys that you
              make in just one hour. As long as they emerge from the feeling of
              drone, whatever that means to you.
            </p>

            <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
            <p>
              Anyone who is curious about making tiny playful drone games
              together. You don’t need to know how to make games, you don't need
              to know about drones, you don't need to know about jams. We
              welcome any beings who would like to tap into the drone vibrations
              that hold us all together.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a drone?</h3>
            <p>
              Drones are sustaiiiiiiined sounds or looooong tones. Drones are
              the vibrations that underpin all things, that occupy the spaces
              between us, that hold us together. Every year at the end of May we
              celebrate drone day, a day where people make drone sounds all
              around the world. People have made collaborative sounds with
              insects, with refrigerators, with synths, with snowmobiles, with
              their own voices, with hundreds of people, alone in their homes,
              in every possible way. Listen?
            </p>

            <h3>What is a game jam</h3>
            <p>
              It’s an event where people come together to make games together.
              It’s like a quilting bee, a hackathon, or a gathering when people
              get together to cook a bunch of different desserts together (is
              this a real thing? It should be!)
            </p>

            <h3>What is a game?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes! A game is anything that moves you or makes your bones sing.
              When you were very small, you played in infinite ways. There were
              explorations, there were imaginings, and you were a delightful,
              heart-melting little monster. Everything you put your tiny little
              fingers on was a plaything. Drone jam is an invitation to make
              anything that moves or delights you. Please start with that spirit
              of tactile and sensory play!
            </p>

            <h3>Where is drone jam?</h3>
            <p>
              Our conversations will be online, on Discord. We’ll post the final
              games to Itch and/or the droneday.org website.

              <li>
                Drone toys: Make a toy or instrument that people can use to make
                their own drone experience like this site (click on things to
                make noise)
              </li>
              <li>
                Tiny drone: You could make a tiny game or toy in 30 minutes.
                Tiny drones are drones
              </li>
              <li>
                Silent drone: You could make a game, toy, or web thing that
                plays with the idea of drones, vibrations, or deep listening --
                without playing any sound. Here’s an example!
              </li>
              <li>Visual drone: You could paint an eternal tone</li>
              <li>
                Story drone: You could write a story about a tiny creature that
                lives in the spaces between your cells, singing the vibrations
                that keep you alive
              </li>
              <li>
                Body drone: You could make a harmonious drone game that you play
                with your voice and the voices of your friends (no computers
                needed)
              </li>
              <li>Dirt drone: You could make a drone game for plants</li>
              <li>Food drone: You could make a meal that feels like drone</li>
              <li>
                Celestial drone: You could tap into the movement of the stars to
                control a character on a website
              </li>
              <li>
                Bridge drone: You could attach a vibration sensor to a bridge
                and let the cars make drones for you
              </li>
              <li>
                Scavenger drone: You could repurpose the skeleton of another
                project and transform it into a drone toy
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tips</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Teams: If you want to jam alone, you can! If you want to jam
                with friends, bring them! If you want to make new friends to jam
                with, come to the kickoff on May 7, 1-2:30 pm ET. If you need to
                miss the kickoff but need a team, let us know!
              </li>
              <li>
                Community: There will be coworking in the Discord. Join us in to
                cowork, colearn, or vibe with other people
              </li>
              <li>
                Ideas: You can bring an idea or you can come find one. There are
                so many ideas
              </li>
              <li>
                Reuse, revive, resource: If you want to re-use materials, revive
                the bones of lost projects, use templates or resources to build
                your game, that’s welcome!
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep it small: The idea should be so small that you can make it
                with your team in one joyful rush of energy (a few hours),
                everything after that is experimenting and playing around for
                fun.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be experimental: - Half-working, uninterpretable, and strange
                interpretations of extended tones are very welcome.
              </li>
              <li>
                Energy: Drone Jam is a gentle, slow jam. Work with people who
                make you feel good about yourself, work in a way that feels good
                for you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Yes/No: Yes to mutual respect, curiosity, experimentation, care,
                rest, and listening. No to racism, transphobia, sexism, ableism,
                spamming.
              </li>
            </ul>
