            <h1>Livestream Guide</h1>
            <br />
            <br />

            <p><em>For total beginners</em></p>
            <h2>What is a Livestream?</h2>
            <p>
              A livestream is a way to broadcast sound and/or video over the
              internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              (You don’t need to livestream to celebrate drone day. Solo drones
              at home with your cat, your family, or your walls are entirely
              welcome.)
            </p>
            <h2>Tools and equipment needed:</h2>
            <p>
              You will need a microphone and may want a webcam. Many phones have
              these built in, so if you are looking for an easy option, use your
              phone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider the space you are performing in. If you are using a
              camera, does the view capture the magic that you are trying to
              create? Can you craft a beautiful visual and sonic world? You can
              surround yourself with all your favourite things. You can point
              the camera to your face, to your hands, or your lovingly adorned
              plant.
            </p>

            <h2>Ways to livestream:</h2>
            <p>
              Don’t be overwhelmed. There are a lot of options. But you can
              choose one that feels in reach, and explore other options another
              time.
            </p>
            <h3>
              If you have no internet and want to share with someone far away
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can use your telephone and call a friend and make music for
                them over the phone.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
              If you are comfortable on social media and want something easy
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you use Facebook* on your phone or your computer there is
                <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1636872026560015"
                >
                  a button to go live.</a
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                If you use Instagram* on your phone, there is
                <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://help.instagram.com/292478487812558"
                >
                  a button to go live.</a
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                If you use Twitter* on your phone, you can use
                <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/periscope-broadcast"
                  >Periscope</a
                >
                to livestream
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These will all notify your followers, so (unlike the video meeting
              option below) you aren’t totally reliant on inviting people
              manually.
            </p>

            <h3>If you are comfortable with video meeting software</h3>
            <p>
              You can use almost any video meeting software to stream. This
              includes

                and many more.</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              For video meeting software, you can email the link or share it on
              your social networks.
            </p>
